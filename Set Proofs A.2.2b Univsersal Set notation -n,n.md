### Describe the sets $\bigcup^{N}_{n=1} (-n,n)$ and $\bigcap^{N}_{n=1} (-n,n)$

The union of $-n$ and $n$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would represent the set of $\mathbb{Z}$ by definition of the set of integers.

The intersection of $-n$ and $n$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would be the empty set $\emptyset$ by definition of an empty set. This is because every element in the first set, $-n$, would always be negative; yet $n=n$ for both sets. Thus these sets would never overlap because $n$ would never be negative.
