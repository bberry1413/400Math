#JamesClerkMaxwell developed a mathematical theory to describe light and other forms of radiation in terms of _oscillating_, or wave-like, electric and magnetic fields. 
- **electromagnetic radiation** includes visible light, microwaves, television signals, radio signals, x-rays and other forms of radiation
	- _electromagnetic radiation is categorized by #Wavelength and #Frequency_
- **wavelength**, $\lambda$, is the distance between a given point on a wave and the corresponding point in the next cycle of the wave.  ![[wavelength1.png]]
- **frequency**, $\nu$, is the number of waves that pass a given point over some unit of time, usually per second (a rate but not)
	- units for frequency given in **Hertz**=$\dfrac{1}{s}$ or $s^-1$
- üí°Like distance, speed and time (see [[Percents, Proportions and Rates]]) there is a relationship between the _speed at which the wave is created_, c (m/s), and the length of the wave (usually a distance given in meters, m or feet, ft)
	- we also have to take into consideration the _direction the wave is forming: **Direction of Propagation**_
	
$c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8~\text{m/s}$ -> the speed of all forms of visible light and electromagnetic radiation in a _vacuum_

$\therefore~~c=\lambda \times \nu$
just like $\text{speed}=\dfrac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$ -> the difference is the _units_. b/c Hertz ($\nu$) is measured in 1/s, we can _multiply by the distance ($\lambda$) to find the speed, c, in m/s_

- üí°UV radiation has _**shorter**_ wavelengths than visible light
	- xrays have even shorter wavelengths
- Infrared radiation, microwae ovens and tv and radio transmissions are _**longer**_ than visible light

EXAMPLE 6.1 WORDING:
"The frequency of the radiation used in cell phones covers a range from about 800 MHz to 2 GHz. (MHz stands for "megahertz", where 1 MHz = $10^6$ 1/s; GHz stands for "gigahertz", where 1 GHz =$10^9$ 1/s). What is the wavelength (in meters) of a cellphone signal operating at 1.12 GHz?" #RearrangeFormula

Given: 
$\nu=1.12~\text{GHz}$
$c=2.998 \times 10^8~\text{m/s}$
$c=\lambda \times \nu$ -> solving for wavelength, $\lambda=\dfrac{c}{\nu}$
_we need to convert GHz to 1/s (1 GHz =$10^9$ 1/s)_

 $\lambda=\dfrac{2.998 \times 10^8~\text{m/s}}{1.12\times 10^9~\text{1/s}}=0.268~\text{m}$
