Iodine Clock Rxn #ExperimentalExplanation 

- **Effects of Concentration and Temperature**
	- If the concentration of a reactant is ‚Üë, the #rxnrate will ‚Üë as well
	- Chemical Rxns occur more rapidly at higher temperatures
- **Catalysts** 
	- substances that accelerate chemical reactions but are not themselves consumed
	- surface area of the solid reactant can also effect the #rxnrate. The smaller area = ‚Üë rxn rate
	- DUST EXPLOSIONS
- **Rate Equation (rate law)**
	-  resulting relationship between reactant concentrations and rxn rate

Consider the decomp. of $\ce{N2O5} \rightarrow 2\ce{NO2} + \frac{1}{2}\ce{O2}$ #ExperimentalExplanation 

1. Starting with 1 mol of $\ce{N2O5}$ the initial rxn rate = $0.24~\text{mol}/\text{L}\cdot\text{hr}$ (Avg Rate)
2. Starting with 0.5 mol of $\ce{N2O5}$ the initial rxn rate = $0.12~\text{mol}/\text{L}\cdot\text{hr}$  _it is reduced by 1/2_

- Since the concentration of reactants and rxn rate are proportional for a reaction it can be expressed by the rate equation

üí°Rate of reaction = $-\dfrac{\Delta[\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta\text{time}}=k[\text{Reactant}]^{\text{rxnorder}}$ #rxnrate #RateEquation 

For any reaction with reactants A and B:

$$aA+bB \rightarrow xX~~\therefore~~\text{rxn rate}=k[A]^m[B]^n$$

where _m_ and _n_ are found by determining the **order** of a rxn. _They must be determined by experiment_

- _Catalysts don't always appear in the formula but ARE included in the Rate eq_
- **order of rxn**: exponent of concentration term 
	- overall rxn order = sum of exponents

For the decomposition of $\ce{N2O5}$:

$\text{Rxn~Rate}=-\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{NO}]}{\Delta t}=k[NO]^2[\ce{Cl2}]$
