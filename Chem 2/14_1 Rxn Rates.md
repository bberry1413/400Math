## Reaction Rates
$\text{Reaction Rate} =\dfrac{\Delta~\text{CONCENTRATION}}{\Delta t}=-\dfrac{\Delta[\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta\text{time}}~\text{or} \dfrac{\Delta[\text{Product}]}{\Delta\text{time}}$

- **Chemical Kinetics**
	- Seeks to define rxn rate and determine it experimentally.
	- Shows how temperature and reactant concentration influence rxn rates
- **reaction mechanism**
	- shows how atoms and molecules behave in a rxn at the particulate (atomic) level
- _catalysts speed up chemical rxns_
	- they speed up rxns *without* being chemically changed
- _reagents trigger reactions_
	- they are added to a system to cause the chemical rxn (See [[03_0 Chemical Rxns Index]])

### Example 14.0 
#ExperimentalExplanation 
Consider the decomposition of $\ce{N2O5} \rightarrow 2\ce{NO2} + \frac{1}{2}\ce{O2}$
![[rxnrategraph1.png|375]]
- üí°_as time goes on, the concentration of $\ce{N2O5}$ **DECREASES**_ because it is a reactant
	- _The #rxnrate is the **slope** of the concentration amount (mol/L) vs time graph_ (seen above)
- Since concentration is decreasing the equation used to calculate rxn rate is _**Negative**_
$\text{Rxn Rate} =-\dfrac{\Delta[\ce{N2O5}]}{\Delta t}$ 
- where $\Delta[\ce{N2O5}]=[\ce{N2O5}]_{Final}~-[\ce{N2O5}]_{Initial}$ and $\Delta t$ is elapsed time in minutes
- RECALL: "Average Rate of Change" 
	- $m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ (See [[00_07 Graphs and Graphing]])

###### TO FIND THE AVERAGE REACTION RATE OVER A GIVEN TIME PERIOD
(between 40 and 55 mins: $t_1=55~\text{mins}$ and $t_2=40~\text{mins}$)
$\text{Rxn Rate} =-\dfrac{\Delta[\ce{N2O5}]}{\Delta t}=-\dfrac{1.10-1.22 ~\text{mol/L}}{55-40 ~\text{min}}=0.0080 ~\text{mol/L}\cdot\text{min}$

EXAMPLE 14.1 WORDING:
"Using these data, estimate the value of (a) the average rate of change of the dye concentration over the first 2 minutes, and (b) the **average rate of change** _during_ the fifth minute (from t=4 mins to t=5 mins) " #AverageRateOfChange #rxnrate 

###### TO APPROXIMATE A RXN RATE AT A SPECIFIC CONCENTRATION (Instantaneous Rate) 
üí°_Use values CLOSE to the specified concentration (when $[\ce{N2O5}]=0.34~ \text{mol/L}$) on BOTH sides_ #Approximate
$\text{Rxn Rate} =-\dfrac{\Delta[\ce{N2O5}]}{\Delta t}=-\dfrac{0.22-0.42 ~\text{mol/L}}{380-240 ~\text{min}}=0.0014 ~\text{mol/L}\cdot\text{min}$
- _Here the $[\ce{N2O5}]=0.34~ \text{mol/L}$ isn't given on the chart or in the graph_ 
	- _using values above and below it will allow an "approximation" of the rate at that specific concentration_
	- _the closer the values the more accurate the approximation_ #Limits
