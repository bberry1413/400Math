- During a chemical rxn the amount of reactants $\downarrow$ over time
	- Rate of _appearance_ of products can be expressed as positive
		- these do not need (-) b/c ‚Üë [C]
-  Rate of appearance of $\ce{NO2}$ will be 2x the rate of disappearance of of $\ce{N2O5}$ #ExperimentalExplanation 
	-  This is because of the stoichiometric requirements from the decomp. equation $\ce{N2O5} \rightarrow 2\ce{NO2} + \frac{1}{2}\ce{O2}$
	-  _Every 1 mol of $\ce{N2O5}$ consumed creates 2 mol of $\ce{NO2}$_
###### Rate Expresion:
$\therefore~~~aA~+~bB \rightarrow cC~+~dD$ #RelativeRate 

but b/c $-\dfrac{\Delta [\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta t}=\dfrac{\Delta [\text{Product}]}{\Delta t}$

$\therefore~~~\text{Rxn Rate}=-\dfrac{1}{a}\dfrac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t}=-\dfrac{1}{b}\dfrac{\Delta [B]}{\Delta t}=+\dfrac{1}{c}\dfrac{\Delta [C]}{\Delta t}=+\dfrac{1}{d}\dfrac{\Delta [D]}{\Delta t}$

Rate Expression for the decomp. of $\ce{N2O5}$:
$\ce{N2O5} \rightarrow 2\ce{NO2} + \frac{1}{2}\ce{O2}$

$\text{Rxn Rate}=-\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{N2O5}]}{\Delta t}=\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{NO2}]}{\Delta t}=\dfrac{2}{1}\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{NO2}]}{\Delta t}$ #RateEquation

###### To Create A Rate Expression: 
1. Identify **Reactants** and **Products**
2. Create an expression with the stoich. coefficients as ratios (fractions)

**EXAMPLE 14.2 WORDING:**
"Relate the rates for the disappearance of reactants and formation of products for the following reaction: $4\ce{PH3}\rightarrow~\ce{P4}+6\ce{H2}$" #RelativeRate 

**_Solution:_**
- The stoich. coefficients can be used to evaluate the relative rate expression for the disappearance of the starting material and the formation of the products

$\text{Rxn Rate}=-\dfrac{1}{4}\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{PH3}]}{\Delta t}=+\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{P4}]}{\Delta t}=+\dfrac{1}{6}\dfrac{\Delta [\ce{H2}]}{\Delta t}$
