- **Thermal energy**
	- kinetic energy of molecules #nrg
		Recall: [[01_6 Energy]] #KineticNrg #PotentialNrg
	- thermal energy is associated with the xnsfr of energy as heat between a hotter object and a cooler one
- **Law of Conservation of Energy**
	- Energy can neither be created nor destroyed
- **system**
	- object or collection of objects being studied
- **surroundings**
	- everything outside the system that can exchange energy and/or matter with the system
- **thermal equilibrium**
