### Solving Equations
#### $\S$ 1.1 - The Bisection Method 
__Bracketing a Root__

The function $f(x)$ has a __root__ if $x=r$ if $f(r)=0$.

Bracketing the root: find an interval [a,b] on the real line for which one of the pair of {$f(a),f(b)$} is positive and the other is negative.

Root = x-intercept

__If the function is #continuous, if you can find two function values one negative and positive, there exists at least _one_ zero between the two function values.__ = Intermediate Value Theorem

In this example __fig 1.1__, $f(0) f(1)=(-1)(1)<0$ Which means that when x = 0, y = -1 and when x = 1 

Bisection Method __fig 1.2__
Need opposite signs when you plug into the function until you reach the x-intercept
