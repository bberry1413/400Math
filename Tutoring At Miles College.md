# Tutoring at Miles College: Spring 2021 - Fall 2021 
## ABSTRACT
$\quad \quad$ Since January 2021, tutoring services have been provided to students on campus over a variety of subjects, specifically targeting the General Education courses offered at Miles College. The Metacognition Lab currently employs 7 peer tutors: Jakaria Miller$^{**}$, Brooke Jones, Qiana Williams$^{**}$, Kiara Dunlap, Charlisha Harris, Jaren Ross, and Christen Lawrence. They are required to work a maximum of 20 hours monthly, and are compensated $200. During the week of February 15th, 2021, all Metacognition Lab personnel completed an 8-hour training course on Metacognition Learning Strategies with Tina Dorius, the former Metacognition Lab Director. She discussed how to help students identify their Metacognitive processes, growth-mindset, tutor etiquette and general tutor expectations. From it's establishment to the timing of this report, tutoring on campus can be described as a lab or drop-in setting. When students arrive to the lab, they sign a logbook that documents the student's Miles credentials (name, ID number, and classification), the class they are working on and 

$^{**}$_Jakaria Miller and Qiana Williams serve as peer tutors within the TRIO program. They may only tutor TRIO students._

### Report Objectives: 
1. Document obstacles to academic excellence
2. Assess current usage of Metacognition Lab and identify activities during student visits
3. Standardize appointment-based tutoring within the Metacognition Lab and the services it provides
4. Tutor Qualifications and Training
5. Create a guide on tutoring logistics with spaces available
## 1. Document obstacles to academic excellence
### Student Habits
 __I. Students need to develop meaningful interactions with homework.__

EXAMPLES OF INEFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS WITH HOMEWORK:
1.  Online Math and Science Homework
-  _"eenie meenie miney moe"_ 
-  Formatting challenges with units and the specificity required for a "correct answer" (for example, sometimes they have to type the words "billion dollars", rather than input dollar sign for WebAssign to acknowledge a correct answer)
-  Assumption that students are computer savvy - they are being simultaneously assessed on the content, their general computer literacy, and their ability to accurately input data.  
-  __MATH:__ Multistep questions that require you to do problems a _specific way_ in order to get the correct answer. Sometimes it's the only way to work a problem, sometimes it is __NOT__. 
-  Students will use an attempt to see how to work a _specific_ problem so they can just change numbers and input the values into a calculator 

2. Students need some kind of recourse outside of tutoring when reading skills are low. Often, the Metacognition lab services students with reading disabilities and deficiencies. It has been up to the tutor's expertise to provide resources to help with comprehension of required texts, and while we have attempted to accommodate that is often outside the tutor's scope and ability.

4. Students often put off papers and writing assignments. They either rush to try to complete many assignments at once, reducing the quality and the amount of time they have with the content
