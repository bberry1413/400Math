### Let $\mathbb{R}$ be as usual the set of all real numbers. Express in words what these statements mean and determine whether they are true or not. Do not give proofs; just decide on the meaning and whether you think they are valid or not.

- (a) $\forall x\in \mathbb{R}, x\ge 0$
This statement is false because it means, "Every x that is in the set of all real numbers must be greater than or equal to zero." The set of real numbers includes numbers less than zero.

- (b) $\exists x\in \mathbb{R}, x\ge 0$
This statement is true because it means, "There exists a number $x \ge 0$ that resides in $\mathbb{R}$."

- (c) $\forall x\in \mathbb{R}, x^{2}\ge 0$
This statement is true because it means "Every $x$ within $\mathbb{R}$ has a square that is greater than or equal to zero." Even the smallest numbers or the most negative numbers within $\mathbb{R}$ will have a square greater than or equal to zero.   

- (d) $\forall x\in \mathbb{R},\forall y\in \mathbb{R}, x+y=1$
This statement is false because it means, "Every $x$ and $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ has a sum equal 1. " There will be other sums other than 1 for all $x$ and $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

- (e) $\forall x\in \mathbb{R},\exists y\in \mathbb{R}, x+y=1$
This statement is true because it means, "Every $x$ and some $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ have a sum equal 1." Any number within $\mathbb{R}$ has another number that can be added to it and the sum will be 1.

- (f) $\exists x\in \mathbb{R},\forall y\in \mathbb{R}, x+y=1$
This statement is false because it means, "Some number $x$ and every $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ have a sum equal 1."  There will be an $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ where a $x$ cannot be added to it to equal 1.

- (g) $\exists x\in \mathbb{R},\exists y\in \mathbb{R}, x+y=1$
This statement is true because it means "Some $x$ and some $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ have a sum equal 1." There are several examples: $x=0.2$ and $y =0.8$ is one example.
