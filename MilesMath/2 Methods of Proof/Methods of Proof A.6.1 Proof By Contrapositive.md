### Prove the following assertion by contraposition: If x is irrational, then $x+r$ is irrational for all rational numbers $r$.
If Then statement: If **x is irrational** then **x+r is irrational for all rational numbers.**
The Contrapositive: If **$x+r$ is rational for all rational numbers $r$**, then **$x$ is rational.**

Then there exists $\frac{a}{b}$ such that $x+r=\frac{a}{b}$. It is given that $r$ is already a rational number, let it be given by $\frac{p}{q}$, and therefore $x$ can be written as:
$x=\frac{a}{b} - \frac{p}{q}$
$x=\frac{aq-bp}{bq}=\frac{w}{z}$ where $a,b,p,q,w,z \in \mathbb{Z}$
$\therefore$ by proof by contrapositive, if $x$ is irrational, $x+r$ is irrational for all rational numbers $r$. 
$\blacksquare$
