### Show that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational by giving an indirect proof

#### Proof:
Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then by definition, $\sqrt{2}=\dfrac{a}{b}$ where  $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \in \mathbb{N}$. Let us also assume that $\dfrac{a}{b}$ is in simplest terms, that is that a and b have no common factors. The expression can be rewritten as: $2=\dfrac{a^2}{b^2}$ and finally as, $2b^2=a^2$ .  It follows that by definition, a is an even number and b is a multiple of a, meaning it is also an even number. But it was given that a is not a multiple of b, and here lies the contradiction $\rightarrow \leftarrow$
$\therefore$ by proof by contradiction, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

_This proof relies on the definition of a rational number: r is rational if r = a/b for some integers a and b, with b ne 0. We may assume that a and b have no common factors because otherwise, we would simply reduce a/b by canceling all common factors._
