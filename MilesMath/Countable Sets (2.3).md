A sequence of real numbers, formally, is a function whose domain is the set of $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers and whose range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. _Are there sets that cannot be arranged into a list? What sets of real numbers can be enumerated?_

#### Example 2.3

The rational numbers can be arranged into a list. To find such a scheme define the "rank" of a rational number $\frac{m}{n}$ in its lowest terms (with $n \ge 1$) to be $|m|+n$. Now begin making a finite list of all the rational numbers at each rank;
