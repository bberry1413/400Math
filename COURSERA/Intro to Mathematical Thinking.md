CONJUNCITON: $\phi \wedge \gamma$ means both $\phi$ and $\gamma$ are true

_At 2:49 - lecturer makes a statement "Well, if we have two statements, Phi and Psi, Phi & Psi means that they're both true." NOT NECESSARILY. Then that would defeat the purpose of checking the validity of such statements. Lecturer means to say, "IF both phi and psi are true statements, then Phi & Psi is also a true statement">>which he does state at 3:03_

- If both $\phi$ and $\gamma$ are true then $\phi \wedge \gamma$ will be true
