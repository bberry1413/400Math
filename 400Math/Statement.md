I first became aware of this program through Mr. Charles Morris at Miles College in Birmingham, Alabama. I am also employed at Miles as the campus tutor(Basic Skills Specialist-TRIO and Metacognition Lab Director). I enrolled at Miles as a non-degree-seeking student to take additional upper-level math courses. Moving forward, I want to study mathematics, and I need to fill in any content gaps in my Mechanical Engineering background. This semester, I took Mr. Morris for Numerical Analysis and Real Analysis, and he asked about my plans. I told him I intend to teach mathematics at the college level, and was applying to grad schools in the area. He encouraged me to apply to South Alabama. Becoming an instructor has always my end goal, even before I earned my Engineering degree, and I would like to begin that process now. Specifically, because I am interested in learning all that I can about Mathematics, I want to earn an MS in Mathematics.
