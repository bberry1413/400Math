The Decade of Artificial Intelligence

1. Andrew Ng “AI is the new electricity.”

- Image Recognition
	- ILSVRC - ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification at large scale. It was used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the classification model and also provided the data to train big models.
	- Convolution Nerual Networks (CNN) 
		- A CNN created by researchers at U of Toronto achieve an error rate of only 16% in the ILSVRC
	- Cat vs Dog
		- Jeff Dean and Andrew Ng trained a large neural network of 16,000 processors to recognize images of cats (despite giving no background information) by showing it 10 million unlabled images from Youtube videos.
	- Never Ending Image Learner 
		- NEIL is a computer program that works 24/7 learning information about images that it finds on the internet. It’s goal is to learn common sense relationships in everyday life, as it relates to humans. 
	- Microsoft and Google machines beat humans at image recognition at the 6th edition of the ILSVRC.
- Siri
- Alexa
- Tesla Autopilot
- Google Assistant 
- Sophia
	- A social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia can imitate human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics.
- Kinect for Xbox360
	- Wii
	- Plastation wand thingy
	- Occulus 
- AI winning games
	- IBM Watson wins Jeopardy
		- A natural language question answering computer
	- AlphaGo beats world champion Lee Sedol at Go four out of five times.
	- AlphaGo is upgraded to AlphaZero and free of any human guidance except the basic game rules, learned how to play master level chess by itself in 4 hours. It beat Stockfish, the best AI player, in a 100 game match without losing a single game. 
	- OpenAI Five, a coordinating team of AI, beats the five person world champions at DOTA 2. They are the first AI to beat the world champions at an esports game. 
	- Solving a Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand
		- OpenAI’s successfully trained a robot hand called Dactyl that adopted to the real-world environment. The robot was entirely trained in the simulated environment but was able to transfer the knowledge into a new situation successfully.
- AI Creation
	- GAN - Ian Goodfellow pitted two neural networks against each other. 
	- FAIR trained two dialog agents (chatbots) to communicate with each other in order to learn how to negotiate. As the chatbots conversed, they deviated from human language and created their own language to communicate with one another.
	- Deepfakes
		- media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone else’s likeness using artificial neural networks. They often combine and superimpose existing media onto source media using machine learning techniques known as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs).
		- The Deepfake Detection Challenge invites people around the world to build innovative new technologies that can help detect deepfakes and manipulated media. Identifying manipulated content is a technically demanding and rapidly evolving challenge, so companies are working together to build better detection tools. The organizers of the challenge are AWS, BBC, CBC, Facebook, First Draft, Microsoft, New York Times, WITNESS, and XPrize.
- Open source deep learning framework
	- Google released Tensorflow to the public allowing everyone a tool to build great models. Tensorflow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. IT has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the best in machine learning and developers easily build and deply machine learning powered applications.
	- PyTorch open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. Developed by Facebook’s AI research lab FAIR. While has a python interface, C++ can also be used.
- Scandal
	- Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal was a major political scandal in early 2018 when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of peoples’ Facebook profiles without their consent and used it for political advertising purposes. The one good thing that we got out of this issue is that people start to know the importance and security of their data.

Weapons of Math Destruction
Ch 4- Propaganda Machine
“And increasingly the data-crunching machines are sifting through our data on their own, searching for our habits and hopes, fears and desires. With machine learning, a fast-growing domain of artificial intelligence, the computer dives into the data, following only basic instructions. The algorithm finds pattersn on its own, and then, through time, connects them with outcomes.”

“Compared to the human brain, machine learning isn’t especially efficient.” Where a child will learn a lesson once, it takes a machine learning program “millions or billions of data points to create its statistical models of cause and effect.”

“…for the first time in history, those petabytes of data are now readily available, along with powerful computers to process them.”

“These advances in natural language have opened up a mother lode of possibilities for advertisers. The programs ‘know’ what a word means, at least enough to associate it with certain behaviors and outcomes, at least some of the time. Fuled in part by this growing linguistic mastery, advertisers can prove for deeper patters. An advertising program might start out with the usual demographic and geographic details. But over the course of weeks and months it begins to learn the pattersn of the people it’s targetsign and to make predictions about their next moves. It gets to know them. And if the program is predatory, it gauges their weaknesses and vulnerabilities and pursues the most efficient path to exploit them.”
