### Describe the sets $\bigcup^{N}_{n=1} [n,n+1]$ and $\bigcap^{N}_{n=1} [n,n+1]$

The union of $n$ and $n+1$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would represent the set of all positive integers $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.

The intersection of $n$ and $n+1$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would represent the set of all positive integers $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. This is because every element successor in set $n$, is also an element within set $n+1$, which also includes $n$.
