### In the preceding exercise suppose that $S=\emptyset$. Could either statement be true? Must either statement be true?

The "for all" statement could be true. The statement could be $\forall s\in S, S=\emptyset$.
The "there exists" statement is always false because there is nothing to verify that "there exists" within the empty set. 

No, both statements do not need to be true.
