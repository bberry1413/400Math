#### Proper Definitions
#subsets 
Subsets: every element of A is also an element of B $A\subset B$
#intersection
Intersection: set consisting of elements of BOTH sets. 
#set_equality 
To show sets are equal $A = B$, show $A\subset B$ and $B\subset A$ 
#### Set Proof Frames
__Subset Proof Frame
Let $x \in A$
Show $x\in B$
Then $A\subset B$
$\blacksquare$__
_x started in one set, shown in another set = #subsets $A\subset B$_

__Set Equality Proof Frame
Let $x\in A$
Show $A\subset B$
Let $y\in A$
Show $B\subset A$
Then $A = B$
$\blacksquare$__
Must show subsets both ways to show #set_equality: $A\subset B$ and $B \subset A$_
