### A.9.3) Explain what must be done in order to prove an assertion of the following form: (a) $\forall s\in S$ "statement about s" is true. (b) $\exists s\in S$ "statement about s" is true.

- (a) $\forall s\in S$ "statement about s" is true.
In order to prove a "for all" statement is true, every element of S must hold true for the "statement about s."

- (b) $\exists s\in S$ "statement about s" is true.
In order to prove a "there exists" statement is true, only 1 element of S must hold true for the "statement about s."

In order to disprove a "for all" statement, a "there exists" statement will be used to show that at least one element of S does not fit the "statement about s."

In order to disprove a "there exists" statement, a "for all" statement will be used to show that not one element of S fits the "statement about s."
