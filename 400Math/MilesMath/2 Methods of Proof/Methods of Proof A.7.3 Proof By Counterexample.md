### State both the converse and the contrapositive of the assertion "Every differentiable function is continuous." Is there a difference between them? Are they both true?

If-Then Statement: If **a function is differentiable**, then **it is continuous.**

Converse: If **a function is continuous**, then **it is differentiable.**

This is not always true and can be disproved with a counterexample:
$f(x)=|x|$ is an example of a continuous function that is not differentiable.


Contrapositive: If **a function is not continuous**, then **it is not differentiable.** 

Since the original conditional statement is true then the contrapositive is also true. A function that is not continuous is also not differentiable.
