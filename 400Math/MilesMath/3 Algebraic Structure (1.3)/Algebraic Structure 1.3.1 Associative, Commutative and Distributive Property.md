### 1.3.1 The field axioms include rules known often as associative rules, commutative rules and distributive rules. Which are which and why do they have these names?

A1 holds the commutative property of addition, M1 holds the commutative property of multiplication. It is commutative because it occurs between two items, indicating that order does not affect the sum or product.

A2 holds the associative property of addition, M2 holds the associative property of multiplication. It is associative because it occurs between three terms, indicating the number of terms does not matter.

AM1 holds the distributive property. It is named that way because multiplication is distributed over addition to the terms added.
