### Describe the sets $\bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} \big(-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n} \big)$ and $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} \big(-\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n} \big)$

The union of $-\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{n}$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would be the set of all real numbers $(-\infty,\infty)$.

The intersection of $-\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{n}$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would be the empty set $\emptyset$ by definition of an empty set. This is because every element in the first set, $- \frac{1}{n}$, would always be negative; yet $n=n$ for both sets. Thus these sets would never overlap because $\frac{1}{n}$ would never be negative.
