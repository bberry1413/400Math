A.2.3c) Describe the sets $\bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} [n.n+1]$ and $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} [n.n+1]$

The union of $n$ and $n+1$, starting with n=1, would be the set of positive real numbers $[1,\infty)$

The intersection of $n$ and $n+1$, starting with n=1,  would be the empty set $\emptyset$ by definition of an empty set. This is because every element in the second set, $n+1$, would always be 1 greater than items in the first set, n; thus these sets would never overlap because $n$ and $n+1$ would never equal.
