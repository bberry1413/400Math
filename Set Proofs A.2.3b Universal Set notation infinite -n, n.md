### A.2.3b) Describe the sets $\bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} (-n.n)$ and $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} (-n,n)$

The union of $-n$ and $n$, starting with n=1, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, would be the set of all real numbers $(-\infty,\infty)$.

The intersection of $-n$ and $n$, starting with n=1,  would be the empty set $\emptyset$ by definition of an empty set. This is because every element in the first set, $- n$, would always be negative; yet $n=n$ for both sets. Thus these sets would never overlap because $n$ would never be negative.
